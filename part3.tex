\section{Results for evolutionary approach 1}
\label{sec:results_1}

Like in section \ref{sec:challenges} already mentioned unstable simulation results and non-reproducibility were encountered which make it hard to interpret the results. Thus, good weights are interpreted mostly as weight with a high potential of a good reward. //
The same evolutionary algorithm was tested with slightly different configurations concerning hyper-parameters. 
The best distances of every generation were plotted with a logarithmic scale and can be seen in figure \ref{fig:results_1}.

In the first configuration a fixed input value was used and only 4 of the 7 output joints were controlled. ...
